# Regression-with-a-Flood-Prediction-Dataset

This project aims to create a model to predict the probability of a region flooding based on various factors. By applying regression techniques like Multiple Linear, Ridge, and Lasso, we'll identify key factor of a region flooding based on various factors. The evaluated parameter is the R2 score.
