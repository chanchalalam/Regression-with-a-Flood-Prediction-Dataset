# Regression-with-a-Flood-Prediction-Dataset

This project aims to create a model to predict the probability of a region flooding based on various factors. 
1. By applying Ml Techniques
2. Cleaning, Outlier removal, Imputation and Feature Engineering of data.
3. Creating the base models instances and its hyperparameter description.
4. Providing the base parameter predictions and metrics with visualization of working of the model.
5. Creating the models hyperparameter tuner and estimators.
6. Testing the hyperparameter and selecting the best of the estimators.
7. Using the new hyperparameters, provide how different is base model from the tuned or generalized model.
